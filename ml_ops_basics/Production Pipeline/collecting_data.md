# Importance of Data

## Quality
- ML biggest problem is bad data
- Better data = most improvement to Pipeline Lifecycle
- data is a **first class citizen**
- bad data = bad results

1. understand user
2. ensure data covers the high predictive signal
3. source, store, and monitor quality data resonsibly


## Collection and Monitoring
1. what kind of data
2. how much data is available
3. how often does new data come in
4. is the data annotated?
   1. how expesive would it be to label it?

- translate user needs into data needs
1. data needed
    - what data do we have that describe the user
2. features needed
    - what data do we have that describes what the user needs
3. labels needed
    - what should we label to monitor success

### Checking Data Quality
- data source
- check if its refreshed
- consistency of units, data types
- monitor outliers and errors

### data effiveness
- intuition of data value can be misleading
- look at data that gives more info
- feature enginering maximize predictive signals
- feature selection helps you chose the features that give you the most value

### Data Labeling
- good labels are needed for data
- raters are people that label your data
- three types of raters
  - generalists
  - subject matter experts
  - your users
